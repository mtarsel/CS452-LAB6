==========

Render a scene with a light pointed in a certain direction and save that into a
framebuffer. In the framebuffer, it is saved as a shadow texture.

After we fill the framebuffer, we transform the perspective to where the shadow
is rendered. To render the shapes and shadow, we use fragment and vertex
shaders.
